# 18F Handbook URLs

A URL shortner to use in conjunction with our [18F Handbook](https://github.com/18F/handbook/). 18F is in the process of wrapping our arms around our existing documentation &mdash; we&rsquo;ve got a lot of it &mdash; and migrating it all to GitHub. In the process, links get broken and people aren't sure where to look. A URL shortner gets around this by providing us with a single, canonical source for information that will eventually live in the handbook.

## Installation

This is a Jekyll project, so you'll need to make sure you have [Jekyll installed](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then you should be able to:

1. `git clone git@github.com:18F/handbook-urls.git`
2. `cd handbook-urls`
3. `jekyll serve`

The site will then be available at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000).
